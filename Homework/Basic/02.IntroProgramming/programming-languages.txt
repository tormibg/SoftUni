1. C++ 
Similarities :
	The main similarity between C# and C++ is that they both inherited basic syntax and the first letter of their name from C.
	Like C++, C# programmers must use the keyword virtual to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses.
	The name "C sharp" was inspired by musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.[8] This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1
Differences :
	Garbage collector in C#
	New control flow statement in C# - for each
	Applications built in C# may not perform as well when compared with native C++.
	
2. Java
Similarities :
	Both Java and C# support signed integers with bit widths of 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits.
	Both languages offer library-defined arbitrary size integer types.
	Garbage collection
	All Objects are References
Differences :
	in C# -> Implicit (inferred) anonymous classes
	Java does not permit pointers or pointer-arithmetic
	Java Will Run on "Any" Operating System

3. Visual Basic .NET
Similarities :
	VB.NET and C# is a part from .NET Framework development platform
	They are both developed, managed, and supported by the same language development team at Microsoft
	They compile to the same intermediate language
Differences :
	in C# - Multi-line and intra-line comments
	Assigning and comparing variables uses the same token: =. Whereas C# has separate tokens, == for comparison and = to assign a value
	VB.NET identifiers are not case-sensitive.
	
4. PHP
Similarities :
	Both platforms are used to build web apps.
Differences :
	PHP variables are declared without specifying the type of the identifier
	PHP arrays are dynamically sized and they can contain a mixture of data types

5. C
Similarities :
	Syntax in C# is similar to C
	In C and C # has a structure and block programming
Differences :
	C language is not object-oriented
	Garbage collector in C#
